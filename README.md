## 🖥️ Installing U6143_ssd1306 Display

- Launch Raspi-Config
```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
Choose Interface Options Enable i2c

- Run setup_display_service.sh script
```bash
cd ~/potentpi2/U6143_ssd1306
chmod +x setup_display_service.sh
sudo ./setup_display_service.sh
```

- Custom display temperature type
  - Open the U6143_ssd1306/C/ssd1306_i2c.h file. You can modify the value of the TEMPERATURE_TYPE variable to change the type of temperature displayed. (The default is Fahrenheit)

## ⚠️ Updating the OS

- Make the log folder for updates
```bash
mkdir ~/potentpi2/logs
mkdir ~/potentpi2/backup_logs
```

- Update and Upgrade the System via script:
```bash
cd ~/potentpi2/scripts
chmod +x apt-get-autoupdater.sh
sudo ./apt-get-autoupdater.sh
```
It's going to look like this froze, but just let it go.

- Start CronJob (optional but recommended if doing headless/always on installation)
```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

  - add the following to the bottom of the document:
  ```bash
  # OS-Auto-Updater
    00 01 * * 0 bash $HOME/potentpi2/scripts/apt-get-autoupdater.sh
      # execute automatic update script and log every sunday at 01:00 am
    50 00 1 * * /bin/bash -c 'cp $HOME/potentpi2/logs/apt-get-autoupdater.log $HOME/potentpi2/backup_logs/apt-get-autoupdater-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).log'
      # saves monthly version of "apt-get-autoupdater.log" on the 1st of every month at 00:50 am
    51 00 1 * * rm -f $HOME/potentpi2/logs/apt-get-autoupdater.log
      # deletes old weekly log on the 1st of every month at 00:51 am
  ```
